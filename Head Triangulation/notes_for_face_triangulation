Plan for epipolar triangulation:

@ Should be easily doable in open-cv
1. Camera Calibration:
    - find intrinsic camera-matrix
        - is it scalabel, because open-cv returns really large values?   Seems so!


@ Look at drone code, maybe you will understand it.
2. Calibrate Uncalibrated Stereo System.
    - find essential matrix (relative position and rotation of one camera in relation to the other)
        - essential matrix = translation x rotation matrix.
        - generate at least 8 face detection pairs for this calibration

    - optimize result using gradient descent?

3. Triangulate Face using epipolar geometry.

! Synchronize Cameras
